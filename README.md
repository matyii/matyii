# hi there 🪐

my name is matyii, i'm a 20 year old working as a full-time IT technician, but hobbyist coder on the side.

my favourite projects:
* [screenie](https://github.com/screeniehost), which is a wip project for a screenshot uploader service

currently, i'm learning to use sveltekit, there are some projects for me to make in the future with this programming language, so stay tuned
